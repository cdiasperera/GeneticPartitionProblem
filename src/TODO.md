* Make blocks global? Ask tutor if that's what they want.
* Separate utlity functions into its own .h file.
* Make fitness measurement more efficient. Can do this over a single for loop
  by comparing the numbers are we proceed through the loop, instead of computing
  two heights and taking the difference.
* Make functions in .c file appear inthe same order as .h file.
* Ask if we have to use blocks metaphor, or can we stick to using sets. Potentially
  convert to sets.
* Make sure program Terminates
* Comment code
* Make sure all files have correct header.
* Write Report (TODO at end)
* Make checkFitnessOfAllChromosomes only run once
* Use structs for tracking strongest/weakest chromosomes
* Make struct from chromosomes?
* Make strongest/weakestChromoFitness indexes constants
* Fix line breaks
* Add cross over to replaceChromosomes
* Make Size_Original_Set 20
* Change metaphor to height of block
* Make a randGen Function
* Make measurefitness more efficient
* Make a struct for chromosomes <- Gonna be annoying
* Make sure all assignments are complete
