# Meeting 3

[toc]

## Agenda

1. ==Go over previous meetings goals==
4. Timeline / Goals for the week / What to do

## Testing Framework

* In terms of parameters, what we should do:
  1. Modify code so that simulation can start with a programmable input set. Done!
  2. Modify code so that simulation configuration can be programmable instead of coded into constants. Done!
  3. Modify code so that it can run simulations over multiple initial sets and come to an average number of iterations. Done!
  4. Modify code so that we can iterate over constants
  5. Modify code so that it can report the output of the results of constants
  6. Modify code so that it can detect when changing a constant makes it worse.

## Time-lines

* End of This Week: Optimize solution speed by implementing complex selection / new generation
* End of Week 5: Start Report on Monday (Oct. 26)
* End of Week 6: Submit on 5th. Due on 8th November

## Next Meeting

* Next meeting: 2020-10-30
* Goals for the week:
  * Ola works out a good simulation configuration
  * I work on finding a configuration automatically.
